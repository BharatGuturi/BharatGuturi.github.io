        <p>I am a Proficient Structural Engineer with diverse experience in analysis and design of low to high rise retail and large scale commercial and residential structures.
        </p>
         <p>   My love for Civil and Structural Engineering began with my curiosity to understand the physics behind structural behaviour of various historical and contemporary structures and my interest to understand the intricate principles involved in design and construction of massive structures.
        </p>  
         <p>  While pursuing my education, the fascinating methods of converting basic principles of physics augmented by mathematics into real structures has enhanced my interest in Structural and Civil Engineering. Challenges in simulating real structures, understanding structural failures using basic principles, addressing concerns faced at construction sites, zeal to research structural behaviour using alternate construction materials has sustained my interest in this field, and made me a proficient Structural Engineer.
